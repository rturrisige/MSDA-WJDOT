The EasyCall corpus is  a database of command speech recorded from healthy individuals and dysarthric patients. This dataset has been collected through a collaboration between the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), the University of Ferrara and the Sant'Anna Hospital of Ferrara, and it  aims at providing a new resource for future developments of ASR-based assistive technologies.
In particular, it may be exploited to develop a voice-controlled contact application for commercial smartphones, and improve dysarthric patients' ability to communicate with their family and caregivers.

It  currently consists of  16683 audio recordings from 21 healthy and 26 dysarthric speakers.  For each speech-impaired individual, dysarthria has been assessed by a neurologist through the Therapy Outcome Measure.   The recordings focus on a small vocabulary, including basic smartphone commands, such as “open contacts”, “start call”, “end call”.  Specifically, these commands are the result of a survey administered to patients  that evaluates which commands are more likely to be employed by dysarthric individuals to use a speech command-based contact application.  In addition, the dataset includes a list of non-commands (i.e., words near/inside commands or phonetically close to commands) that can be leveraged to build a more robust ASR system.
