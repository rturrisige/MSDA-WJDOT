- AF_Synthesis

It contains the codes related to the Chapter "Speech Production Knowledge for ASR". 
It addresses the problem of generating Articulatory Features (AF), given audio and/or phonetic labels. 
The ultimate goal is to integrate articulatory information into the ASR model to improve its performance.

- SA_MSDA-WJDOT

It contains the codes related to the Chapter "Multi-sources domain adaptation".
It uses the MSDA-WJDOT introduced in Chapter 3 to perform unsupervised speaker adaptation in ASR models (Sec. 3.5.1).
